# Building-energy-curtailment-simulation-in-demand-response-event-with-EV-charging

This study aims to provide a building energy curtailment simulation to account for the recency in evolving technologies and analyze how EV charging has an impact on the risk of power outages.

* ``DR_Probability.ipynb`` is the main notebook for this study. The notebook include the important sampling technic for estimating the building energy consumption under extrem heat wave index events.
In addition, sequential monte carlo simulation is adopted in this notebook to estimate the building energy consumption estimation considering EV charging/ discharging events.
* ``Updated EV Charging Profile Data.ipynb`` is the notebook for exploratory data analysis of the EV dataset.
